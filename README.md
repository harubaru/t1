# kernel

This is a tiny kernel I was working on while I was bored with school and have decided to experiment with Operating System Development. In the end, I'm pretty sure I may have wasted 6 months of my life on this. But, it was one hell of a learning experience. The code I wrote definitely needs to be rewritten, I don't consider it half decent by any means.
