Panic - for crashing the kernel when shit hits the ceiling.

Panic functions:

void panic(char *file, unsigned int line, char *str);
	Purpose: print str and hang the system. great for debugging.
	file = the source file the panic occurred in.
	line = the line that this function was called on.
	str = the string you want to print, should summarize the error while being descriptive
	
PANIC(x)
	Purpose: do panic() for you without having to put __LINE__ and __FILE__ in its parameters.
	x = the string you want to print, should summarize the error while being descriptive
